# Inherent complexity

Given a task to solve, the inherent complexity of the problem is a statement oabout how complex the problem is, *not*
about how complex *your solution* to the problem is.

# Accidental complexity

The accidental complexity of a task is a statement about how much complexity your solution has added on top of the
inherent complexity.

--------------

Good, well-engineered software should aim to minimise the accidental complexity.

How do we do this?

* Remove unnecessary abstractions (YAGNI, etc).
* Remove legacy code and features.
* Naming.
* Consistency.
* Document.
