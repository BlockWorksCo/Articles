Error Propagation prevention.
=============================

Even if one device is compromised, limit the damage so the exploit is widely useable.


Mitigation techniques
=====================
- Random stack offsetting.
- Random vector table location.
- Heap randomisation.
- per-device RNG, unique ID for propagation prevention.
