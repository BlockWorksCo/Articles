The concept of cognitive load comes from psychology and refers to the amount of effort required to maintain items
in working memory.

Our working memory has its limits, generally we can hold between 5 and 9 things in memory at one time.

The process of software development relies heavily on the developer understanding large portions of the codebase and
doing this requires them to juggle many quite abstract concepts in their head simultaneously. 
This directly relates to cognitive load.

Cognitive load is categorised into three types, Germane, intrinisic, extraneous.


Example
-------

A heavy cognitive load typically creates error or some kind of interference in the task at hand
