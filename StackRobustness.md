Stack Robustness.
=================
- Stack overflow
- Stack underflow
- Stack corruption.
- Stack pointer corruption.
- pass-by-reference.

Mitigation Techniques
=====================
- Stack CRC checking (cross-task corruption).
- stack bounds checking with an OS.
- random stack offsetting.
- Stack sanitisation.
- Canaries
- Stack-fill
- Correct-sizing.
- avoiding pass-by-reference.
